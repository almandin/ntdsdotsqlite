# SQL Model

# Generalities

Every record in the database has a unique identifier (`id` column). These identifiers are unique database wide, not because they are generated but because they are directly extracted from the NTDS database.

A few choices of data representation are made to make them more easily accessible. For example, dates and duration are represented in seconds or Unix Epoch timestamps, instead of the Microsoft standard representation (number of intervals of 100 nanoseconds elapsed since 1601 ðŸ˜ ).

All of the columns can be `NULL` when no data was availabe or to represent the absence of something (example: Null for password last set attribute meaning the password was never set).

If a SYSTEM hive is provided, data will be decrypted. The encrypted version of the associated columns are kept under columns with the `_encrypted_` prefix in their name. These columns are not present if no decryptions has occured.

## Table `domains`

## Table ???

The process of adding object classes and attributes is quite straightforward if these are not complex references to other intricate stuff. If you need something else which is not retrieved yet, open an issue or a PR ! There is basically one python file for each object class parsed. Objects are retrieved based on their class name directly ! The full list is available in the Microsoft documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/classes).
